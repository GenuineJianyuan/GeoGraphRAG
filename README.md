# GeoGraphRAG

**GeoGraphRAG** is a graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach designed for geospatial modeling, built upon the **S-GMKG** framework.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

GeoGraphRAG enhances geospatial knowledge representation by leveraging the semantic structure of **S-GMKG**, enabling more accurate and context-aware geospatial reasoning.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

- **Benchmarks**: Contains 100 sample cases for evaluating performance.
- **`core/` folder**: Stores the core methods of GeoGraphRAG.
- **`core/utils/llm_config.py`**: Defines the basic configuration for LLM usage.
- **`sgmkg.db`**: An instance of the S-GMKG including:
  - `schema_entity` table: 15,224 entities
  - `schema_relation` table: 77,134 relationships
