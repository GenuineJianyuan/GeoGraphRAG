# GeoGraphRAG

**GeoGraphRAG** is a graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach designed for geospatial modeling, built upon the **S-GMKG** framework. This repository provides:

- Benchmarks for evaluating performance
- Reference implementations of the approach
- Essential information about the underlying **S-GMKG**

By leveraging **S-GMKG**, GeoGraphRAG enhances geospatial knowledge representation, facilitating more accurate and context-aware geospatial reasoning.
